                    <p id="questions"><strong>Can I use my statement of result as proof of achieving a CGPA above 3.5, given that my department doesn't provide access to final year results?</strong></p>
                    <p id="answers">Generally, every scholar is paid with proof that he/she had a CGPA of 3.5 and above in that particular session. However, in these specific cases, you can provide us with your graduating CGPA and previous CGPAs and we can calculate the CGPA for the session.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="questionsCard" id="card2">
                    <p id="questions"><strong>What academic result can be used as a medical student who hasn't taken professional exams yet, considering only first-year results are available?</strong></p>
                    <p id="answers">Medical school uses a pass and fail method and not GPAs. As long as you didn't fail or repeat a session. Provide us with that proof.</p>
